# intelligent_movie_quote_reply_discord_bot
Use EmoRoBERTa (by arpanghoshal) to perform sentimental analysis on input message and determine the type of message (question, greeting etc. and also find buzzwords in it using a rudimentary algorithm made by me using nltk) and then reply with an appropriate movie quote.

It works as a discord bot where it randomly drops a message every now and then.

Libraries used:
nltk
transformers
pytorch (to use transformers)
